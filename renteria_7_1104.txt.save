methods are like small programs in a big program.
I used a method that repeated the program when the anser was wrong/false.
I also used a method to only allow false to repeat a sertian number of times 
this is the count mehtod. 
the while loop was for the number of time the core program 
I used the while loop to again repeat my boolean every time the boolean was
false and the counter to again count the number of times the answer can be 
false
